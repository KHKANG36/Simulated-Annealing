# TSP(Traveling Salesman Problem) Solving with Simulated Annealing 

## Synopsis

In this exercise, I implemented the simulated annealing algorithm in a Jupyter notebook and used it to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between US state capitals. 

## Instructions

You need to setup the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) environment.

## Start Guide

To launch the notebook, run the following command from a terminal with anaconda3 installed and on the application path:

    jupyter notebook Simulated_Annealing Algorithm.ipynb 

## Algorithm

This is implemented by Python algorithm
