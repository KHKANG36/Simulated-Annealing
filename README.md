In this exercise, I implemented the simulated annealing algorithm in a Jupyter notebook and used it to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between US state capitals.

To launch the notebook, run the following command from a terminal with anaconda3 installed and on the application path:

    jupyter notebook AIND-Simulated_Annealing.ipynb
